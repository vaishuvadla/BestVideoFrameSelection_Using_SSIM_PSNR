# BestVideoFrameSelection_Using_SSIM_PSNR
This application extracts frames from a video and saves them as images. It then compares the structural similarity index (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of the frames to identify the highest quality frame. The best frame, based on these metrics, is saved separately, ensuring the selection of the most visually similar and clear frame.
